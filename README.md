# spania-2022
Bike trip in northern Spain in 2022. The trip is shown on this [map](https://carve11.github.io/spania-2022/) which has been made in Python 
using the [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) library. One can click on the routes on the map in order to 
get a detailed elevation profile. Does not work well on a touch device.
