# Bike trip Northern Spain 2022
Map and elevation profiles from a bike trip in Northern Spain in 2022 ([map](https://carve11.github.io/spania-2022/)). Have used Python and JS to create the visualization of the trip where there are interactive features in the map and elevation profile chart. One can click on the routes on the map in order to get a detailed elevation profile, and when hovering on the profile one gets distance and elevation information. Mainly use of [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/) library with some Javascript code, `gpxpy` to parse bike computer GPX files, and `Jinja2` templating. Latest update use MapBox GL JS directly and not through Bokeh `add_tile` since MapBox GL JS supports static font size during zooming (float) and since Bokeh pinch zoom do not work very well (as of version 3.3.3).

This is a static document with all data from the stages, which explains the size of the document.
